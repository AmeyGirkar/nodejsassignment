# Node + Express Service Starter

This is a simple API sample in Node.js with express.js based on [Google Cloud Run Quickstart](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/quickstarts/build-and-deploy/deploy-nodejs-service).

## Getting Started

Server should run automatically when starting a workspace. To run manually, run:
```sh
npm run dev
```
```
1)Write a Node.js program that creates a simple HTTP server. When a client sends a request to the server,the server should respond with a "Hello, Students!" message

2)Write a Node.js program that reads content from a file named "input.txt" and writes the content to a new file named "output.txt "

3)Write a Node.js program that creates an HTTP server and handles different routes. The server should respond with "Hello, World!" for the root route ("/") and "Page Not Found" for any other route

4)Write a Node.js program that uses the OS module to retrieve information about the current operating system

5)Write a Node.js program that uses the Path module to manipulate file paths

6)Create a command-line Node.js program that simulates a basic calculator. The program should allow users to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations on two numbers.
